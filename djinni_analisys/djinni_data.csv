We‚Äôd like to improve it even further with you on the team.<br><br>The demand for our work is extremely high, so we get to pick and choose the projects that we want to take on ‚Äì and the same goes for you. Before you‚Äôre assigned to a project, you‚Äôll be personally asked if you‚Äôre interested in that particular task and if you don‚Äôt like it, you‚Äôll just get something else. That‚Äôs the beauty of having a sales team that greatly outperforms our delivery capacity.<br><br><br><b>Let your code have a real impact</b><br><br>At Reef Technologies, we don‚Äôt have managers. Thanks to the group decision-making framework, Sociocracy 3.0, every member of the team can be sure that their opinion will be valued. (Check it out here, you‚Äôll wonder how you‚Äôd survived in traditional organizations until now!) <br><br>The Founder of our company doesn‚Äôt only take care of sales, bureaucracy, and client relationships - he is also a programmer, so all of us really do work together and understand the job at hand.<br><br>What type of projects would you work on? We mainly accept offers from startups and small-to-medium businesses from the US, the UK, and Canada. Some projects may only last a couple of hours, while others take even a few years for us to complete. There is one thing that you can be sure of, though - that it will always be your personal choice whether to work on a particular project or reject it. What would you have thought about these?<br><br>-financial data warehouse, which aggregates over 31 000 time series into a few hundred charts for a fintech company from London<br>-graph data search/visualization system for auditors/investigators from Norway<br>-super scalable WAF optimized down to extremely low running costs for a client from Chicago, IL<br>-multisource cloud object synthesizer library for a storage provider from San Mateo, CA<br>-report generator/inventory tracker for an e-commerce/healthcare company from Canada<br>-k8s-based revenue optimizer for large private GPU compute clusters in North America<br>-paper product level tracker for toilet cleaners from Canada<br>-hydrant certification report generator for Australian plumbers<br>-multi-tenant hospitality management system for large properties in the US<br>-large scale information display system for retailers (international)<br><br>We have already delivered those, but you can be sure we‚Äôve got even more exciting projects coming up in the future. <br><br>All that without ever setting foot in an office. We have completed those projects ‚Äì and many more ‚Äì from the comfort of our own homes, from tropical beaches and from our favorite coffee shops. Some of us work early in the morning, others start off late in the night. Each of us is free to choose their own programming environment. We know our engineers are competent enough to organize their work and achieve top productivity in their own way. Do you think you'd enjoy this type of freedom? Become one of us and make the world a better place by delivering more than just lines of code.<br><br><br><b>Want to know more?</b><br><br>-Check out the Reef Technologies Handbook to see our company policies (https://github.com/reef-technologies/handbook).<br>-Want to see what our clients have to say about our work?
